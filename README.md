## üéØ Features
<sup>[(Back to top)](#------------------------)</sup>

### Easily Move Your Tokens Across Different Chains

Our project allows you to seamlessly transfer supported tokens across various EVM-compatible chains.
Here's how we make it happen:

#### 1. Circle Payments & Transfers API

Currently, this method exclusively supports USDC transactions.
It enables the movement of tokens between Ethereum and Polygon PoS networks, and vice versa.

#### 2. Circle CCTP

With Circle CCTP, you can transfer USDC, DAI, USDT, and WETH tokens across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche networks.

#### 3. Polygon LxLy

Using Polygon LxLy, you can bridge USDC, DAI, and USDT tokens between Ethereum and Polygon zkEVM networks,
ensuring smooth movement in both directions.

#### Supported Chains and Tokens

Here's an overview of the chains we currently support along with the tokens they accommodate:

- Ethereum: USDT, USDC, DAI, WETH
- Ethereum Goerli: USDC
- Arbitrum One: USDT, USDC, DAI, WETH
- Arbitrum Goerli: USDC
- Avalanche: USDT, USDC, DAI, WETH
- Avalanche Fuji: USDC
- Polygon PoS: USDT, USDC, DAI, WETH
- Polygon Mumbai: USDC
- Polygon zkEVM: USDC, USDT, DAI
- Polygon zkEVM Testnet: USDC

### Affordable Transaction Fees

We believe in cost-effective solutions. Our platform offers a reasonable fee structure:

- Circle API: 4% fee (capped at $20) for all transactions
- LxLy and CCTP: 3% fee for stablecoins (capped at $20)

### Upcoming Enhancements

We're committed to continuous improvement. Here's what's in the pipeline:

- **Multi-Routing:** Soon, you'll enjoy the freedom of movement across chains without restrictions.
- **Expanded Token Support:** We're working to add more tokens to facilitate seamless transfers across different chains.
- **Fiat On & Off-Ramp:** We plan to introduce a feature that will allow you to easily convert between digital assets and fiat currency.

Stay tuned for these exciting enhancements!
